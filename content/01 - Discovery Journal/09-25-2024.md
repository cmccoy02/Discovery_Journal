# Discovery Journal - Navigation

## Prompt

We are working on a project for our expeditionary entrepreneurship class. As a group, we have decided to explore the realm of education, specifically how students manage focus, meeting deadlines, and learning through using online platforms. 

Together we have brainstormed ways to learn more about issues that students are facing. Through observation, immersion, and empathy interviews, we have come up with a number of ways to delve into this problem. 

Now, we need your help to analyze the data that I am going to provide you with, (a .csv document). Look over this document and provide any insights you might have: are there any gaps in our problem navigation? Which of these options seem that they would yield the strongest results? Any additional methods we should consider? What are some potential interview questions we should use? 

To get the best possible answers, please ask clarifying questions about our problem that we are trying to solve so that you can get the most accurate heading. 

### First Response 
Thank you for providing the data. Before I analyze the CSV document, it would be helpful to clarify a few aspects of your project so that I can provide targeted insights:

1. **Problem Scope**: Is the primary focus of your project on improving student focus, meeting deadlines, or the use of online platforms for learning? Or is it a combination of all three?
    
2. **Target Audience**: What age range or educational level are you focusing on (e.g., high school, college, online learning platforms like Coursera, etc.)? Are there specific kinds of students (e.g., working students, students with learning disabilities) that you're interested in?
    
3. **Key Outcome**: What is the ideal outcome of this project? Are you looking to build a tool, provide recommendations, or identify key pain points in the education system?
    
4. **Current Insights**: Have you or your team already identified some specific challenges in how students manage focus, deadlines, or learning through online platforms? If so, what are they?
    

These clarifications will help me guide the analysis and offer tailored suggestions on research methods, gaps, and additional interview questions.

### Clarification

**Problem scope:** As of right now, the primary focus of this project is just understanding the main issues that students face, primarily with focus and online learning. We want to fully understand the breadth and depth of this issue before diving into any solutions. 

**Target Audience:** Currently the majority of our interviews and observations are targeted at college students. There are a few other individuals that we will be interviewing as well, but the primary focus is college students as that is where we have the most access. 

**Key outcome:** The ideal outcome is to help students reclaim their focus so that they can learn better and become greater contributors in the professional world to make a meaningful impact on the world. 

**Current insights:** We have already identified that our attention is a finite resource, something that is bought and sold between different products and services, something stolen from us, taking away our ability to make progress and create meaningful work.

## Result 
### Gaps in Problem Navigation:

1. **Digital Environment Immersion**: While your immersion exercises cover physical homework settings, you could extend this to **immersion in the digital tools** that students use. For instance, participate in online study sessions (e.g., Pomodoro groups or virtual libraries) to see how students interact with online platforms when trying to focus.
    
2. **Contextual Interviews**: You’re interviewing some stakeholders like recruiters and high school students, but consider adding **online educators**, administrators, or even developers of educational tools (e.g., Zoom, Canvas, or Coursera product managers). These individuals could offer insights into how these platforms are designed and where they fall short in helping students maintain focus.
    
3. **Technological Distractions**: A gap might exist in understanding how technological distractions affect focus. Consider observing how college students interact with **social media** or other non-educational apps when studying. How do students manage or fail to manage distractions on their devices?
    
4. **Cognitive Overload**: Investigate whether students experience **cognitive overload** from switching between multiple online platforms (e.g., Canvas for assignments, Zoom for lectures, Slack for group work). This could be a critical contributor to loss of focus.
    

### Strongest Methods:

1. **Empathy Interviews**: These seem to be the strongest approach so far, especially if you're engaging students deeply to uncover personal pain points. Keep using a conversational approach and ask questions that help you understand **how students feel** about their lack of focus or distractions.
    
2. **Immersion**: Immersing yourself in the act of doing homework or trying to use online platforms gives you firsthand insights into the frustrations that students face. Expanding immersion to mimic real student study conditions (like using LMS platforms while managing distractions) could provide more depth.
    
3. **Observational Methods**: Observing how students actually work, including body language, time spent on tasks, or how they switch between study apps and social media, can give you real-world data on the behaviors that reduce focus.
    

### Potential Interview Questions (Refined):

1. **For College Students**:
    
    - When you’re using an online platform (e.g., Zoom, Canvas), how do you manage distractions? What typically pulls your attention away?
    - How do you feel when you’re switching between online platforms (for lectures, assignments, etc.)? Does it affect your ability to focus?
    - How does the environment around you (physical or digital) impact your ability to concentrate on your work?
    - Do you have any strategies that help you stay focused when working online? What tools or apps do you use to minimize distractions?
2. **For Online Platform Developers/Educators**:
    
    - How do your platforms ensure students remain engaged and focused during learning sessions?
    - What features of current learning platforms do you think contribute to distraction or loss of focus for students?
    - What feedback have you received from students about their experience using your platform?
3. **For Professionals (Recruiters/Employers)**:
    
    - In your experience, how do distractions during remote or online work affect student preparedness for professional environments?
    - What key traits or habits do you notice in employees who have strong focus, and how do you think these could be cultivated earlier in students?

### Additional Methods to Consider:

1. **Behavioral Experiments**: Set up controlled experiments where students are asked to study with different tools or under various conditions (e.g., quiet environment vs. noisy, distraction-free vs. with phones). Measure their productivity and ability to stay focused.
    
2. **Focus Surveys**: Distribute a survey among a large group of students to quantitatively gauge how distractions (e.g., social media, multitasking) impact their focus on online platforms. This could help you identify broader trends.
    
3. **Eye-Tracking or Screen-Tracking Studies**: If feasible, use technology like screen tracking (on laptops or smartphones) to monitor how long students stay on task during study sessions and when they drift to distractions like social media.
    

These additions should help you explore more angles and generate deeper insights into how students manage their focus.
