### Agrinova
**Project AgriNova** was an initiative launched by Intuit Inc., centered on improving the livelihoods of farmers in India by leveraging mobile technology. The project sought to address the significant information asymmetries and exploitation within India’s agricultural market. Specifically, it aimed to provide farmers with timely, relevant information on crop prices via SMS, allowing them to make more informed decisions regarding when and where to sell their crops.

  

**Key Problems Faced by Farmers:**

  

1. **Lack of Access to Market Information**:

Farmers often lacked real-time access to crop prices, leading them to depend on intermediaries or middlemen for information. These middlemen would frequently manipulate prices to benefit themselves, leaving farmers with lower profits. Farmers would typically only know the market prices after selling their produce, which meant they had little to no negotiating power  .

2. **Exploitation by Middlemen**:

Middlemen were a significant part of the Indian agricultural system. They operated by entering into opaque agreements with wholesalers and other buyers, thus effectively controlling the price farmers would receive. These private arrangements made it hard for farmers to get fair value for their produce .

3. **Lack of Bargaining Power**:

With limited access to direct market information, farmers were at a considerable disadvantage when negotiating prices. This led to poor selling conditions, where many farmers were forced to accept whatever prices were offered by middlemen, often far below fair market rates .

4. **Geographical and Technological Barriers**:

Many farmers in India lived in rural areas with limited access to infrastructure. Even if they were able to gather market information, getting it in real-time and at affordable rates was a challenge. Moreover, these farmers were often not well-versed in using technology to aid in their agricultural practices .

  

**Project AgriNova’s Approach:**

  

The solution proposed by Project AgriNova was to use mobile phones, specifically SMS-based services, to deliver critical market information to farmers. By subscribing to this service, farmers could receive daily updates on crop prices in different markets. This innovation was a low-cost, scalable solution that could potentially reach millions of small-scale farmers who relied on traditional methods of farming and selling produce  .

  

The primary objective of AgriNova was to empower farmers to make better business decisions, bypass middlemen, and take control of their economic circumstances. Additionally, it was designed to explore whether a profitable business model could be built around delivering this kind of agricultural information, making it sustainable in the long term.

  

**Challenges for Project AgriNova:**

  

Despite its potential, the project had to navigate several challenges:

  

• **Farmer Education and Adoption**: Many farmers were unfamiliar with mobile technology or hesitant to pay for a service they had not used before. The success of the project depended on changing entrenched behaviors and proving the value of the service .

• **Scalability**: Although the service was promising, scaling it across India’s diverse agricultural landscape posed logistical and operational challenges, including how to ensure the accuracy and reliability of market data  .

  

In summary, Project AgriNova was a technologically driven attempt to resolve the deep-rooted issues of information asymmetry and exploitation in Indian agriculture. By providing real-time market prices through mobile phones, it sought to empower farmers and break the cycle of dependency on middlemen. However, it also faced significant hurdles in terms of farmer education, service adoption, and ensuring widespread access to reliable information.
