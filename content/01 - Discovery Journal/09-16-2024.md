## Problem Interest List

I have noticed that many students like myself struggle with focusing and staying on task when it is time to get things done. Medical issues aside, our phones and computers are distraction machines and completing homework assignments and projects takes way longer than it should. This is an issue I could definitely see myself diving into for 4 months or more. 

Since being in college and shopping on my own, I have noticed a scarcity of high quality, durable, and affordable clothing. I want to be able to buy stuff that lasts, to get the most possible utility out of an item. Finding these pieces results in an internet scavenger hunt trying to track down the best brands. Several of my friends and thousands more people online have expressed the same concern. 

Wifi routers and home networks are unnecessarily complicated and confusing. No matter how technical of a person you are, these things prove to be an issue. Setting up, restarting, and connecting are all significant pain points through the customer journey of using these products. Also, they're ugly. Not everyone wants to have a router that looks like a spaceship in their home.
