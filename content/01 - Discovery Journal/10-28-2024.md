Notes from *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant* 

What feels like play to you but work to others? This is what you should pursue. This is where you excel

For me:
- Design
- Quality materials
- Productivity optimization 
- Learning


## Class Notes
You're not the one who feeds the 5,000, you're the one who brings the loaves and fishes. What do I bring (do)? The outcomes will happen depending on what I bring. Leave the unknown and the impossible up to God.
