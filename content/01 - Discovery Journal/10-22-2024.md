## When to do What you Love
If you want to make hundreds of millions, it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the most. This isn't really because of the extra motivation you get from working on something that interests you, it's because way is to start a startup.

It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it.

What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once you're good at technology.
