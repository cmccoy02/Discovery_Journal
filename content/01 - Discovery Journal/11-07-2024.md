**Problem:** *Non-technical decision makers often do not understand the cumulative scope or impact of technical debt.*
## Reddit Exploration: r/experienceddevs
This sub was FULL of information about technical debt and its consequences. Each post illustrated the difficulty of working at companies with large amounts of technical debt and communication gap between devs and non technical leaders at companies. 

## Perplexity Analysis
1.	Difficulty in prioritization: Many developers report that technical debt tasks are often deprioritized in favor of new features, as noted by one commenter: “logistic like new features tend to win over squashing technical debts most of the time.”
2.	Lack of understanding: There’s a clear communication gap between developers and non-technical stakeholders. As one developer mentioned, “I find it hard to convince people that some debts worth investing in.”
3.	Quantification challenges: Developers struggle to quantify the impact of technical debt, making it harder to justify to management. One comment states: “I find coming with a quantify impact for technical debts to convince people is counter productive.”
4.	Integration into regular work: Some successful strategies involve incorporating technical debt work into regular feature development, rather than separating it out. As one developer noted: “We largely gave up on this because separating technical debt out into other tickets meant it never got prioritized.”
5.	Need for trust and credibility: One commenter highlighted that success in addressing technical debt often depends on the business trusting the developers’ judgment: “It helps if ‘the business’ already trusts you with making the right decisions.”
6.	Long-term consequences: The post illustrates the severe consequences of neglecting technical debt, with one comment vividly describing how unaddressed debt can lead to systemic issues and developer burnout.

**"You need to understand their concerns and talk about how paying down tech debt will help meet those concerns. If you come to the conclusion that paying down tech debt doesn't help meet project goals, then you don't pay it down."**

**"We have tickets for our tech debt and they are marked as such. We prioritize them and estimate them in a separate refinement session only for devs. We get 20% of every sprint to work on tech debt, no questions asked.It took a lot of educating the business to get to this point though.Sometimes we have larger tech debts that won't fit in the 20%. We, as devs, workout the business value of addressing that tech debt and/or the "cost of not doing it". We then sell it to the business like any other feature would be. Mostly we sell it to the PO and they sell it forward if they need to."**

*You have to make a strong case for why a tech debt issue needs to be solved - ie, “If we don’t fix this, we will have slower system performance”, or “solving X will save ___ developer hours each week that could have gone towards feature work”*

*Fixing this will result a net profit of $XXXXXX/year.*

### Metrics for team performance
**DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment):**
DORA is a research program that studies DevOps practices and their impact on software delivery performance. It identifies four key metrics:
	•	Deployment Frequency
	•	Lead Time for Changes
	•	Time to Restore Service
	•	Change Failure Rate
	They measure the engine, not the contribution of individual pistons
**SPACE:**
SPACE is a framework for measuring developer productivity, proposed by researchers from GitHub and Microsoft. It stands for:
	•	Satisfaction and well-being
	•	Performance
	•	Activity
	•	Communication and collaboration
	•	Efficiency and flow
This framework aims to provide a more holistic approach to understanding and measuring developer productivity, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects.

### Metrics for Technical Debt
Use the **Technical Debt Ratio (TDR)** as the primary metric
The Technical Debt Ratio (TDR) is a good starting point for quantifying technical debt in a way that’s easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand. It can be expressed as:
TDR = (Remediation Cost / Development Cost) x 100
Where:
	•	Remediation Cost: Estimated time to fix all known technical debt issues
	•	Development Cost: Estimated time it would take to rebuild the system from scratch
	
“T-shirt sizing” approach
For each technical debt item, use a simplified estimation method like T-shirt sizing (S, M, L, XL) to represent the time required to address it. This allows for quicker assessments while still providing meaningful data.

Features are potential revenue, paying down tech debt is cost. If you spend time paying down debt without generating revenue, then you’re not going survive.
