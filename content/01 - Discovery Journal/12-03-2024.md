## Designing a Solution
### Figma
Start by building out a wire frame of the app, what goes where?

Key features:
- Data visualizations - tech debt projections
- Dashboard - contains charts, predictions, team notes
- Release notes - the primary location to see what's new

**Design Language**
Fonts: OCR -A/B, nabla (for fun), JetBrains mono



### Rough Examples

### Functionality 
New feature releases are passed through a filter (bridge? funnel? come up with a cool name later)

As features are passed through a filter, areas of concern are highlighted. This will be translated into easy to read, color coded visualizations. 

From there, we derive a number that represents the outstanding tech debt in terms of dev hours. 

- First, get existing information on allocated dev hours
- Assuming that new feature sprints are also measured in dev hours
- % of new sprint that will result in tech debt (This is an estimation based on past releases)
