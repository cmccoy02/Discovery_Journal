## Interview - CTO
1. **Tech Debt Management**:

• **Definition and Impact**: Tech debt accumulates when quick solutions are implemented to meet immediate needs, but they lead to future challenges in maintenance and scalability. The CTO mentioned that while this approach allows for fast progress, it can become burdensome, especially as systems evolve.

• **Prioritization and Planning**: Tech debt is tackled based on urgency and the team’s capacity. For example, Travelpass has tech debt scheduled for 2025, reflecting the need for a structured approach to manage significant items over time.

• **Product vs. Tech Debt Tensions**: Product managers focus on feature delivery and customer-facing updates, often pushing tech debt to the background. The challenge lies in balancing these priorities to avoid stalling development due to unaddressed issues.

2. **Root Causes of Tech Debt**:

• **Time Constraints**: The CTO emphasized that time constraints are the main contributor to tech debt. When projects are rushed, shortcuts are taken, leading to issues that need revisiting. In startups, rapid iteration often leads to patches rather than structural solutions.

• **Legacy Systems and Feature Additions**: Frequent feature updates and changing requirements can create “Frankenstein” systems, where old and new code clash, causing inefficiencies and complications.

3. **Communication Challenges with Non-Technical Stakeholders**:

• **Explaining Tech Debt’s Value**: Communicating the importance of addressing tech debt to executives and non-technical stakeholders is often challenging. The CTO compared it to explaining foundational work on a building; it’s critical but not immediately visible.

• **Visualization and Metrics**: Using metrics or dashboards to visualize tech debt (e.g., categorizing it by size or complexity) could improve buy-in from business stakeholders by making tech debt more tangible.

4. **Potential Solutions for Tech Debt Tracking**:

• **Quantifying Tech Debt**: The CTO proposed tracking tech debt in “dev hours” or “time thresholds,” similar to financial debt, setting a limit on how much tech debt can accumulate before it must be addressed.

• **Project Management Tools**: Implementing a project management tool that flags overdue tech debt or high-impact bugs could help prioritize tech debt items. Using concepts like “T-shirt sizing” (small, medium, large) for tech debt tasks might also aid in assessing workload.

5. **Importance of Technical Background for Leadership Roles**:

• **Understanding Tech Helps Decision-Making**: Leaders with a technical background tend to make better decisions in tech-driven companies, as they understand the intricacies and limitations of technical solutions.

• **Value of AI in Development**: The CTO mentioned that AI tools, like ChatGPT, enhance productivity, reduce low-level coding tasks, and enable developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.

## Interview Developer
1. **Daily Impact of Tech Debt**:

• **Increased Development Time**: Tech debt makes even simple tasks more complex and time-consuming due to the need to work around existing code structures.

• **Maintenance vs. New Features**: Developers often balance adding new features with maintaining or restructuring old code, which can slow down development progress.

2. **Management of Tech Debt**:

• **Regular vs. Burst Efforts**: Small tech debt items are addressed continuously, while larger items are reserved for scheduled sprints, depending on team resources and priorities.

• **Prioritization Challenges**: There is often a trade-off between maintaining existing code and pushing forward with new features, influenced heavily by time constraints and product team priorities.

3. **Primary Causes of Tech Debt**:

• **Time Pressures**: Fast-paced development, common in startups, prioritizes speed over sustainable code practices, leading to the accumulation of tech debt.

• **Legacy Systems and Iterative Development**: Some tech debt stems from outdated systems, while iterative development processes and frequent feature updates can create new tech debt as the product evolves.

4. **Communication with Non-Technical Stakeholders**:

• **Visibility and Understanding**: Non-technical stakeholders may struggle to understand the value of tech debt work, as it doesn’t directly result in new features. The CTO’s support is essential for translating these technical needs to other departments.

5. **Suggestions for Improvement**:

• **Tracking and Visualization**: A systematic approach, such as a tech debt dashboard, could help quantify tech debt and improve communication with stakeholders by making tech debt more transparent.

• **Tech Debt Thresholds**: Setting a “debt limit” (similar to financial debt) might help keep tech debt manageable by defining a threshold that, once reached, requires dedicated resources to reduce.

6. **Developer’s Perspective on Tech Debt**:

• **Moderate Frustration**: While the developer finds some satisfaction in addressing tech debt, it becomes frustrating when deadlines don’t allow sufficient time for thorough fixes.

• **Impact on Productivity and Morale**: Left unmanaged, tech debt adds complexity, reducing efficiency and increasing developer dissatisfaction with their projects.
