**Author:** Robert Greene

## Highlights

---

- People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something

---

- Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid

---

- Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually

---

- Treating everyone equally means ignoring their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who excel

---

- those who make a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of all.

---

- the better you are at dealing with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you become.

---

- properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist than a denier or a bungler.

---

- An emotional response to a situation is the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feelings

---

- patience is the supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good will happen—the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several steps into the future

---

- a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is unworthy of respect.

---

- But the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you grief

---

- Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. Keep them under control. 

---

- Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire.

---

- They are missing a presence that will never return

---

- Image: The Sun. It can only be appreciated by its absence. The longer the days of rain, the more the sun is craved. But too many hot days and the sun overwhelms. Learn to keep yourself obscure and make people demand your return.

---

- Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner

---

- in a strictly military sense a fortress is invariably a mistake. It becomes a symbol of power’s isolation,

---

- You have chosen war. What will happen will happen, and what it is to be we know not; only God knows.”

---

- never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person’s brain power. That is an unforgivable sin.

---

- Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment requires. Adapt your mask to the situation—be protean in the faces you wear.

---

- Know how to be all things to all men

---

- Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.


---

- Hesitation puts obstacles in your path, boldness eliminates them

---

- entering action with boldness has the magical effect of hiding our deficiencies

---

- Your timidity infects people with awkward energy, elicits embarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.

---

- Largeness of scale deceives the human eye.

---

- Money often makes a man small, but a man like him makes big money.
