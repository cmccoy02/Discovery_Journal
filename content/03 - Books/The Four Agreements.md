# The Four Agreements  
**Author:** Don Miguel Ruiz

## Highlights

---

- it’s not the stars that create light, but rather light that creates the stars. “Everything is made of light,

---

- human perception is merely light perceiving light.

---

- You are dreaming with the brain awake.

---

- Eventually we become someone that we are not. We become a copy of Mamma’s beliefs, Daddy’s beliefs, society’s beliefs, and religion’s beliefs.

---

- There is another part of us that receives the judgments, and this part is called the Victim. The Victim carries the blame, the guilt, and the shame.

---

- Whatever goes against the Book of Law will make you feel a funny sensation in your solar plexus, and it’s called fear.

---

- Even if the Book of Law is wrong, it makes you feel safe.

---

- The Judge decrees, and the Victim suffers the guilt and punishment.

---

- The human is the only animal on earth that pays a thousand times for the same mistake.

---

- Ninety-five percent of the beliefs we have stored in our minds are nothing but lies, and we suffer because we believe all these lies.

---

- Whenever we feel the emotions of anger, jealousy, envy, or hate, we experience a fire burning within us. We are living in a dream of hell.

---

- No human can condemn another to hell because we are already there. Others can put us into a deeper hell, true. But only if we allow this to happen.

---

- We cannot see who we truly are; we cannot see that we are not free.

---

- That is why humans resist life. To be alive is the biggest fear humans have. Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive

---

- We create this image, but this image is not real. We are never going to be perfect from this point of view. Never!

---

- Humans punish themselves endlessly for not being what they believe they should be. They become very self-abusive, and they use other people to abuse themselves as well.

---

- In your whole life nobody has ever abused you more than you have abused yourself

---

- your personal dream of heaven.

---

- Through the word you express your creative power. It is through the word that you manifest everything.

---

- All the magic you possess is based on your word. Your word is pure magic, and misuse of your word is black magic.

---

- Sin begins with rejection of yourself. Self-rejection is the biggest sin that you commit.

---

- We have learned to lie as a habit of our communication with others and more importantly with ourselves.

---

- That is why we must forgive them; they don’t know what they do.

---

- When we see the world through a computer virus, it is easy to justify the cruelest behavior. What we don’t see is that misuse of our word is putting us deeper into hell.

---

- How many times have you hooked other people’s attention, and spread poison about your loved one in order to make your opinion right?

---

- How much you love yourself and how you feel about yourself are directly proportionate to the quality and integrity of your word.

---

- You can attain the kingdom of heaven from this one agreement: Be impeccable with your word.

---

- Taking things personally makes you easy prey for these predators

---

- Either way, it does not affect me because I know what I am. I don’t have the need to be accepted.

---

- it is not what I am saying that is hurting you; it is that you have wounds that I touch by what I have said. You are hurting yourself

---

- Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don’t need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally

---

- It is a big problem when a thousand parts of your mind are all speaking at the same time. This is called a mitote, remember?

---

- Humans are addicted to suffering at different levels and to different degrees, and we support each other in maintaining these addictions

---

- When we really see other people as they are without taking it personally, we can never be hurt by what they say or do.

---

- It is always better to ask questions than to make an assumption, because assumptions set us up for suffering.

---

- We have the habit of dreaming with no basis in reality.

---

- So even before others have a chance to reject us, we have already rejected ourselves. That is the way the human mind works.

---

- We don’t need to justify love; it is there or not there.

---

- The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions. Make sure the communication is clear. If you don’t understand, ask.

---

- Everything is alive and changing all the time, so your best will sometimes be high quality, and other times it will not be as good.

---

- Doing your best, you are going to live your life intensely. You are going to be productive, you are going to be good to yourself, because you will be giving yourself to your family, to your community, to everything.

---

- There are many ways that we hurt ourselves when we don’t like who we are.

---

- If you take action because you have to, then there is no way you are going to do your best.

---

- Action is about living fully. Inaction is the way that we deny life.

---

- You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results, and no reward.

---

- God is life. God is life in action. The best way to say, “I love you, God,” is to live your life doing your best.

---

- So if you fall, do not judge. Do not give your Judge the satisfaction of turning you into a victim. No, be tough with yourself. Stand up and make the agreement again.

---

- The warrior’s goal is to transcend this world, to escape from this hell, and never come back.

---

- Who really stops us from being free? We stop ourselves.

---

- It is time to free yourself of the tyranny of the Judge by changing the foundation of your own agreements. It is time to be free from the role of the Victim.

---

- The real you is still a little child who never grew up.

---

- Your life is the manifestation of your dream; it is an art. And you can change your life anytime if you aren’t enjoying the dream.

---

- Intent is life itself; it is unconditional love. The Mastery of Intent is therefore the Mastery of Love.

---

- Just like hell, heaven is a place that exists within our mind. It is a place of joy, a place where we are happy, where we are free to love and to be who we really are.

---

- But you are no longer a child. Now it’s up to you to choose what to believe and what not to believe. You can choose to believe in anything, and that includes believing in yourself.

---

- for every agreement you break that makes you suffer, you will need to replace it with a new agreement that makes you happy.

---

- We are addicted to being the way we are.

---

- When you are angry, everything around you is wrong, nothing is right.

---

- You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven. Why not dream a different dream?

---

- Imagine living your life without fear of expressing your dreams.

---

- You are no longer responsible for anyone’s opinion. You have no need to control anyone, and no one controls you, either.
