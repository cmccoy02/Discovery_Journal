### **Objective**:

#### In this project, you will explore different data sources to answer a meaningful entrepreneurial question. You will use both **existing private data** and **customer data** that you gather yourself. The goal is to develop a clear understanding of how to combine data from multiple sources to inform decision-making in your entrepreneurial process.

For this project, you will use the [**Entrepreneurial Experiment Template**](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27136/files/9389616?wrap=1) (Included below) provided to guide your work. This template will help you frame your question, plan your data sourcing, conduct your experiment, and analyze your findings.

### **Project Steps**:

1. **Prioritizing Unknowns and Defining Entrepreneurial Questions**
    
    Entrepreneurship involves navigating a large bundle of unknowns. Your task is to identify and prioritize the most critical unknowns that affect your venture. Once prioritized, the most urgent unknown becomes the foundation for your immediate entrepreneurial question—something like “How large is this market?” or “How do I reach my target customers?”
    
    Each entrepreneurial question can generate multiple specific, factual questions that help you design experiments to gather insights. For example, to answer "How do I reach my target customers?" you might need to ask factual questions like:
    
    - What channels do they use?
    - What messaging resonates with them?
    - What are their purchasing behaviors?
    
    These factual questions don’t stand alone; together, they form a clearer picture that helps you answer the larger entrepreneurial question. The goal is to approach experimentation as a way to gather collective insights that guide your next steps as an entrepreneur.
    
2. **Data Sourcing**  
    You must use data from both **public sources**, **private sources**, and **customer data** to answer your question. Specifically:
    
    - **Public Data**: Use **at least three public data sources** to find relevant information for your entrepreneurial question. These can include resources like U.S. Census data, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or Google Trends.
        
    - **Private Data**: Use **at least three private data sources** to gather additional insights. These could include databases like Mergent, Social Explorer, IPUMS, or others we've discussed in class.
        
    - **Customer Data**: In addition to public and private data, you are required to gather **at least one set of customer data** by conducting an exploratory or confirmatory experiment. This might include surveys, interviews, observations, or other methods to gather direct insights from potential customers. You’ll design this experiment to answer a key question that cannot be resolved through existing public or private data.
        
3. **Use the Experiment Template**  
    You will document your project using the [**Entrepreneurial Experiment Template**](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27136/files/9389616?wrap=1) [Download Entrepreneurial Experiment Template](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27136/files/9389616/download?download_frd=1), which will guide you through:
    
    - **Identifying the most urgent unknown**: Start by clarifying the most critical unknown related to your entrepreneurial question.
    - **Experiment Design**: Explain which data sources you’ve chosen and why. Justify why certain sources were selected while others were not.
    - **Conducting the Experiment**: As you gather data from public, private, and customer sources, document your process and reflect on how well the sources met your needs.
    - **Analysis of Data**: Summarize your findings from public, private, and customer data sources, and evaluate how well they answer your entrepreneurial question.
    - **Decision-Making**: Make a recommendation based on the evidence you’ve gathered. This should be grounded in the data from your public, private, and customer sources.
4. **Submit Your Report**  
    After completing the project, submit your final report in the form of the completed [**Entrepreneurial Experiment Template**](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27136/files/9389616?wrap=1) [Download Entrepreneurial Experiment Template](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/27136/files/9389616/download?download_frd=1). This will include your documentation of the process, your data analysis, and your final conclusions or recommendations.
    

#### **Considerations for Data Sourcing**:

- **Public Data**: Ensure that you explore at least three public data sources relevant to your question. Provide a rationale for selecting each one. For example, why did you choose U.S. Census data for demographic information and exclude another source?
    
- **Private Data**: You will need to select at least three private data sources and explain why you chose them. Reflect on the strengths and limitations of each source in addressing your question.
    
- **Customer Data**: For customer data, carefully design your experiment to gather direct insights from potential customers. Consider the most urgent unknown about your customers that requires direct data collection. How will you gather reliable data to answer this unknown? Document your methodology and reflect on any biases or challenges in your experiment.

# Identify the Most Urgent Unknown

## What is your next most urgent unknown?

- _Exploratory: What critical information do you need to move forward, such as identifying the target population or unmet needs?_
    
- _Confirmatory: What hypothesis or assumption are you testing, and why is it critical to validate?_
    

## Why is this unknown urgent?

_(Describe why this unknown is holding you back from progressing. For example, in exploratory research, understanding unmet customer needs might be crucial for designing a solution. In confirmatory research, validating a hypothesis might be essential before making a major decision.)_

## What are your other unknowns, and why are they less urgent?

_(List other unknowns you might need to address later and explain why they are secondary for now. This helps students recognize the iterative nature of the process.)_

My Entrepreneurial question to explore: how college students spend their time outside of class, studying doing assignments etc. How long does the average student study? How long do top students study? How does studying correlate to grades? Do everything you can to find data about this topic and put it together to complete this project. I will edit your answers, your job is to become an expert on the subject, linking me to public and private data sources that have this information to look at. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT US CONDUCTING ANY KIND OF SURVEY OR STUDY. Just get some secondary data sources as well, that will fulfill the requirement.
