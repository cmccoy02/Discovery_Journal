Great feedback! I'll take all of that into account. Scope creep is a good concern and one that I completely agree with. We would start with the most basic, adding features as necessary.

Now the Interviews. I'll give you my markdown files with all of the notes, but they are a little scattered. Here my synopsis of the interviews. I interviewed 4 people so far:

Ashlyn: 20 year old neuroscience major - Mid-high GPA 15-20 hrs/week studying
Scott : 22 year old micro bio pre med major - High GPA 3.97, 40+ hrs/week studying
AJ: 22 year old mechanical engineering major - Mid - high GPA, 20 hours per week studying. 
Autumn: 22 Year old grad student (MFT) - High GPA, 12-15 hrs/ week studying +4ish hours doing therapy observations 

These students come from various backgrounds, are all in different majors, and have different study habits. Across these interviews I got great insight into their process. 

All of these students study with some form of "noise" whether that is music, white noise, soundtrack, or a background TV show. 

All of these students said that distraction is present within their studies, and that they would get more done without as many distractions.

All of them said that learning new material requires more intense focus than reviewing material.

They also all said that the majority of their learning takes place OUTSIDE of the classroom. With lectures reinforcing what they learn. 

The biggest distractions were: phone, youtube, online shopping, texting, friends talking, web browsing, thinking about other assignments while working on assignments!

Some of them will put their phone out of sight, others will delete social media for a period of time, some just power through with sheer will and discipline (I can only imagine how mentally taxing that is)

All of them keep some form of a task list/weekly plan/ priorities. It feels good to check the box. 

My promise proposal (tweak as needed): "If there existed a product/service that cut your study time by 20% while guaranteeing the same results or better in your classes, would you use it?" They all responded yes. 

Willingness to pay: AJ said he would pay up to 20/month (Same as chatGPT plus) for this service, Ashlyn: 15-20/month, Scotty: 10/month, Autumn would not pay for a subscription because she would not want to pay during summer months when there is no class. Makes sense. She said she would however make a one time purchase, or pay for it as she needs it (Think during finals month or during midterms)

These interviews seem promising huh! It is only the beginning. 

Some items of concern: I am friends with all 4 of these people so their answers as far as willing to use a product/pay for it could be biased. Their responses as to their habits however were completely genuine. Another item of concern is that students are an interesting socioeconomic group. We're poor. We hate subscriptions. If they are to use this product, it has to prove it's value.
