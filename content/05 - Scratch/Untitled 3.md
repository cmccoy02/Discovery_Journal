1. **Skewed Distributions**:
• **Findings**: Distributions for Spent, Impressions, and Clicks are heavily right-skewed. A small number of campaigns dominate these metrics, suggesting that a few ads are driving the majority of activity. For example:
• Spent had a median significantly lower than the mean, indicating most campaigns operate on smaller budgets while a few are highly invested.
• Impressions showed a similar pattern, with most campaigns receiving modest exposure but a handful reaching millions of users.

2. **Outliers**:
• **Findings**: Missing values in CPC and ROAS suggest underperforming campaigns or errors in tracking/reporting. For example:
• Campaigns with zero clicks or conversions inflate the denominator in metrics like ROAS, skewing averages.
• Some campaigns with extreme CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) indicate inefficiency in turning impressions or clicks into meaningful results.

3. **Demographic Differences**:
• **Findings**: Bar plots for age and gender revealed uneven targeting. Certain demographics (e.g., a higher proportion of 30-34 age group) might reflect market realities but could also suggest untapped opportunities to expand to other groups.
