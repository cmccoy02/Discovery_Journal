**Key Points:**

  

1. **Customer Clarity**:

• Clarify who the customer is: Are you focusing on the students as users, or is the university the actual customer?

• If it’s the university, align the project’s value proposition with the university’s goals and measures of success.

2. **Individual vs. Group Contributions**:

• Specify which parts of your ideation and observations were developed individually versus as a group. This wasn’t clear in the initial submission.

3. **Customer Profiles**:

• Revisit the customer profiles. Instead of general ideas, use real contacts in your network and expand to a broader sample that covers diverse customer types.

• Submit clusters of customer profiles and identify which were generated independently vs. collaboratively.

4. **Calibration (Step 4)**:

• Reflect on any changes needed for your project focus and clarify customer or problem definitions based on recent insights.

5. **Action Plan (Step 5)**:

• Provide a list of 3-5 concrete actions (e.g., observations, interviews) planned for the next steps. Your deliverable should specify the types of activities you’ll pursue and outline an ideal interview wish list covering diverse customer types.

  

Your professor is open to a resubmission focused on the process rather than just the grade. Make these adjustments in your project to ensure clarity and depth. Let me know if you’d like guidance on any specific steps!
