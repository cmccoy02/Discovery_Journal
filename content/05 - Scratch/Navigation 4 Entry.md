### Empathy Activities:

**INTERVIEW - AJ:** 

Biggest distractions: YouTube, friends, browsing online.

Effective methods: Soundtrack or white noise music. Opening all the tabs/resources that he needs so that he stays within one controlled digital environment with no distractions. 

Other notes: much of his work as a mechanical engineering student requires intense focus to solve complex problems. When he is focused, "In the zone" , these problems take much less time than when his attention is being pulled in different directions. 

**INTERVIEW - Ashlyn:** 

Biggest distractions: friends, phone, online shopping.

Effective methods: Low volume background music, no words. Putting phone AWAY, out of sight out of mind. Deleting social media apps during weeks that are especially busy. 

Other Notes: +90% of the learning that she does takes place OUTSIDE of the classroom. Learning new material requires much more intense focus than reviewing material. 

Both Ashlyn and AJ expressed a willingness to use and pay for a product that would solve this issue. The promise that I proposed was "Would you use a product that saves you 20% of your time studying while guaranteeing the same or better results, would you use it?"  
  
  

### Other Notes

## Possible Personas  
- Cougar students

### Alex  
High GPA - 3.8-4.0  
Spends 30-40 hours studying

### Dylan  
Low GPA ~ 2.0   
Spends <10 hours studying / week

### Megan  
Mid GPA 2.5-3.5  
Spends 12-15/hours studying / week

  
For a 15 credit course load, students should expect to be studying 2-3 hours outside of class for each credit hour. So generally, students should be studying 30-45 hours per week.
