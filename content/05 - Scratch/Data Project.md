# Identify the Most Urgent Unknown

## What is your next most urgent unknown?

- **Exploratory**: What are the average study hours for college students, and how do these hours correlate with academic performance?

## Why is this unknown urgent?

Understanding how students allocate their time is crucial for developing effective educational strategies and tools aimed at improving academic performance. Knowing the correlation between study habits and grades is essential for informing potential solutions. 

## What are your other unknowns, and why are they less urgent?

- Other Unknowns:
  - Differences in time allocation based on major or year in school.
  - The impact of extracurricular activities on study time.These can be explored after establishing baseline data on overall time management.
  - Outlier students (Overperformers or underperformers)

# Formulate the Experiment Objective

## What is the key question or insight you are seeking?

- **Exploratory**: What are the current trends in study habits among college students, specifically focusing on duration and frequency?

## What do you expect to find (if anything)?

- I expect to find that college students typically study for about 15-20 hours per week, with top-performing students studying significantly more.

# Experiment Design

## Target Population

    College students aged 18-25 years.

## Sampling

- **How/where will you reach them?**  
    For surveys: online platforms such as subreddits, social media groups, and in locations like the library. I will also procure data through public data sources like BLS and private sources like NSSE. 


## Recording Results

- **How will you record the results?**  
    I will record results from public and private data sources on my computer using software such as Obsidian and google sheets. Any survey responses will be recorded in google sheets as well. 

- **Where will the data be stored?**  
    Data will be stored in my google drive and locally on my computer.

# Conducting the Experiment

## Execution

- **Who did you actually reach compared to who you targeted?**  
    Reached a diverse group of college students through social media and university channels.

- **How many respondents were there, and from what channels?**  
    Targeted approximately 500 students; received around 300 responses via Google Forms.

- **What did you actually do during the experiment?**  
    Distributed the survey link through various channels and monitored responses.

# Data and Results
### Data Sources 
#### Public Data Sources
1. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) - American Time Use Survey
2. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
3. Pew Research Center 

#### Private Data Sources
1. Statista
2. National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)

## Quality of Data

- **Did you source the right data?**  
    Preliminary analysis suggests that data gathered aligns well with research objectives.The data is relevant and recent. 

- **Did you ask the right questions?**  
    Questions effectively captured insights into study habits.

- **Was the sample size sufficient to avoid bias?**  
    Yes, the sample size is adequate for generalization within the target population.

- **How well does your data answer the original question?**  
    The data provides a clear overview of average study hours and frequency among college students, answering my original question.

# Analysis of Data and Results

## Initial Insights

- **What does the data say?**  
    Preliminary findings indicate that students study an average of approximately 16 hours per week, with most studying between three to five days a week. 

---

# Judgement and Decision-Making

## What Did You Learn?

- **What does the experiment confirm or reject?**  
The data supports initial assumptions about average study hours but reveals variability based on external factors like work commitments, extra curricular activities, and major. 

### Recommendations
Based on findings:
1. Develop resources or tools that help students manage their time more effectively.
2. Consider creating workshops focused on effective study techniques tailored to various majors.

# Conclusion and Reflection

- **Do you feel confident enough to move forward?**  
   Yes, initial findings provide a solid foundation for further exploration of student study habits.

- **What assumptions are still untested?**  
   The assumption that all majors require similar study time needs further validation through targeted research. 
   
This data was collected to determine if students were effectively using their time studying, and if that could be streamlined and improved. I feel that this leaves a lot of gaps that need to be addressed. It is my assumption that students are actively using free and low cost tools to make their studying more efficient already. I will conduct a series of interviews to further explore this idea.
