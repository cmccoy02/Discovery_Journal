# Hackers &amp; Painters  
**Author:** Paul Graham

## Highlights

---

- Good hackers develop a habit of questioning everything

---

- The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. 

---

- The only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded.

---

- A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.

---

- If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.

---

- if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars&#x27; worth of pain

---

- You just have to do something people want

---

- Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money
