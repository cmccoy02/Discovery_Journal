# Hillbilly Elegy  
**Author:** J. D. Vance

## Highlights

---

- Whatever talents I have, I almost squandered until a handful of loving people rescued me.

---

- working-class whites are the most pessimistic group in America

---

- It’s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible. It’s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.

---

- in Ohio, I was the abandoned son of a man I hardly knew and a woman I wished I didn’t.

---

- These men were the gatekeepers to the family’s oral tradition, and I was their best student.

---

- I spent the first eighteen years of my life pretending that everything in the world was a problem except me.

---

- McCoy

---

- There is a story there, though I’ll likely never hear it.

---

- In my immature brain, I didn’t understand the difference between intelligence and knowledge. So I assumed I was an idiot.

---

- They were the scariest people I knew—old hillbillies who carried loaded guns in their coat pockets and under their car seats, no matter the occasion. They kept the monsters at bay.

---

- Mom and Bob’s problems were my first introduction to marital conflict resolution. Here were the takeaways: Never speak at a reasonable volume when screaming will do; if the fight gets a little too intense, it’s okay to slap and punch, so long as the man doesn’t hit first; always express your feelings in a way that’s insulting and hurtful to your partner; if all else fails, take the kids and the dog to a local motel, and don’t tell your spouse where to find you—if he or she knows where the children are, he or she won’t worry as much, and your departure won’t be as effective.

---

- This time was no different. Mom was extra-apologetic because her sin was extra-bad. So her penance was extra-good: She promised to take me to the mall and buy me football cards. Football cards were my kryptonite, so I agreed to join her. It was probably the biggest mistake of my life.

---

- Papaw placed his hand on my forehead and began to sob. I was so afraid that I didn’t even look up at his face. I had never heard of him crying, never seen him cry, and assumed he was so tough that he hadn’t even cried as a baby.

---

- This was hillbilly justice, and it didn’t fail me.

---

- The people who ran the courthouse were different from us. The people subjected to it were not.

---

- To coast through life was to squander my God-given talent, so I had to work hard. I had to take care of my family because Christian duty demanded it. I needed to forgive, not just for my mother’s sake but for my own. I should never despair, for God had a plan.

---

- The road to hell, however, is paved with good intentions

---

- Just knowing that he had cared about me erased a lot of childhood pain

---

- The next months would bring a desperate need for both a heavenly father and an earthly one.

---

- He taught me that lack of knowledge and lack of intelligence were not the same.

---

- I went searching for comfort and found Mamaw alone in a corner of the funeral home, recharging batteries that I never knew could go empty.
