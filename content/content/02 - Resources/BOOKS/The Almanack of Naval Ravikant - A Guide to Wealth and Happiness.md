# The Almanack of Naval Ravikant - A Guide to Wealth and Happiness  
**Author:** Eric Jorgenson

## Highlights

---

- Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.

---

- If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.

---

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

---

- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.

---

- Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich.

---

- But when you put your name out there, you take a risk with certain things. You also get to reap the rewards. You get the benefits

---

- Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.

---

- Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

---

- Earn with your mind, not your time.

---

- you’re doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it’s not about the money.

---

- I’m always “working.” It looks like work to others, but it feels like play to me. And that’s how I know no one can compete with me on it. Because I’m just playing, for sixteen hours a day. If others want to compete with me, they’re going to work, and they’re going to lose because they’re not going to do it for sixteen hours a day, seven days a week.

---

- the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money.

---

- ou cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you.

---

- If you’re counting, you’ll run out of patience before success actually arrives.

---

- I just don’t believe in anything from my past. Anything. No memories. No regrets. No people. No trips. Nothing. A lot of our unhappiness comes from comparing things from the past to the present.

---

- The thing is, I’m addicted to the desiring. I’m addicted to the idea of this external thing bringing me some kind of happiness and joy, and this is completely delusional.

---

- Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

---

- To me, the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don’t even play the game, who rise above it.

---

- “All of man’s troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself.”

---

- Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace into happiness anytime you want.

---

- The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.

---

- Really, I wish I had done all of the same things, but with less emotion and less anger.

---

- the anger and emotions are a huge, completely unnecessary consequence.

---

- When we’re older, we’re a collection of thousands of habits constantly running subconsciously. We have a little bit of extra brainpower in our neocortex for solving new problems. You become your habits.

---

- I say I want to do this, but I don’t really because if I really wanted to do it, I would just do it.

---

- Impatience with actions, patience with results.

---

- Use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in, and then create an environment around you so you’re statistically likely to succeed.

---

- I just want to be the most successful version of myself while working the least hard possible.

---

- Grind and sweat, toil and bleed, face the abyss. It’s all part of becoming an overnight success.

---

- As long as you’re doing what you want, it’s not a waste of your time.

---

- A taste of freedom can make you unemployable.

---

- The modern struggle:
Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising…
Up against armies of scientists and statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, and medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite porn, endless games, and addictive drugs.

---

- I only believe in peer relationships

---

- Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now, and we will never be here again.”
—Homer, The Iliad
