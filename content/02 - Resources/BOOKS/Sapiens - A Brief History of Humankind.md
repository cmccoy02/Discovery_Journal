**Author:** Yuval Noah Harari

## Highlights

---

- In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest

---

- Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous

---

- When humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force

---

- Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to imagine that we are the epitome of creation, and that a chasm separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.

---

- Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.
