**Insight**: Younger males (30–34) exhibit the highest ROAS and conversions, making them the most profitable demographic for ad spend.
**Recommendation**:
• Reallocate 20–30% of the ad budget to campaigns targeting males aged 30–34.
• Design ad content tailored to this demographic, focusing on messaging that resonates with their preferences (e.g., career-oriented or lifestyle themes).
• Monitor performance metrics (e.g., ROAS and conversions) to evaluate the impact of increased spending.

**Anticipated Impact**:
• Improved ROAS and conversions by focusing resources on the most efficient audience.
• Enhanced budget efficiency and reduced wasted ad spend.

**Risks and Validation Considerations**:
• **Risks**: Over-concentration of budget could limit diversity in targeting and neglect potential opportunities in other demographics.
• **Validation**: Conduct A/B testing to compare performance between increased spending on males 30–34 and the current allocation. Use metrics like incremental ROAS to assess the effectiveness of this strategy.
